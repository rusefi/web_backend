As of 2020, the primary goal of rusEFI web is to flow data from early adopters to developers.

1) for developers: log file upload & sharing
1) for developers & early adopters: tune sharing
1) for early adopters: tune update via web



We have [TunerStudio Plugin](https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/wiki/TS-Plugin) as one of the frontends.

# Implementation Details

Based on existing msqur project - our fork https://github.com/rusefi/msqur/tree/prod (note 'prod' branch for rusEFI changes)

Very little of custom phpbb code see https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/tree/master/misc/www/forum
